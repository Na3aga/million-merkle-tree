## 📊 Test Results Overview

### Single Leaf Addition to 1M Tree

```
🔄 Single Leaf Addition Results:
   • Original tree: 1,000 sample leaves → 106ms build time
   • New tree: 1,001 leaves → 79ms build time

## ⚖️ Strategy Comparison

### Method 1: Tree Rebuild (Current Approach)

- **Verification cost**: Increases O(log n) with tree size
- **Rebuild time**: O(n) with total leaves
- **Pros**: Efficient storage, logarithmic proof costs
- **Cons**: Requires full tree rebuild

### Method 2: Individual Leaf Storage (Hypothetical)
- **Gas per leaf**: ~20,000 gas (SSTORE operation)
- **Total for 10 leaves**: 200,000 gas
- **Verification**: Would need different contract design
- **Pros**: No rebuild required
- **Cons**: Linear storage costs, no proof compression

**Result**: Tree rebuild is **74.6% more efficient** for batched additions.

## 🔄 Append-Only Pattern Results

Testing progressive tree growth:

```
🔗 Append-Only Pattern (50 → 66 leaves):
   • +1 leaf: 3ms rebuild, 50,778 gas, 32,040 gas verify
   • +5 leaves: 4ms rebuild, 50,778 gas, 32,070 gas verify  
   • +10 leaves: 5ms rebuild, 50,778 gas, 32,100 gas verify
   • All verifications successful ✅
```

**Pattern Benefits:**
- Constant root storage cost
- Minimal verification gas increase
- Sub-second rebuild times for small additions
- Maintains tree integrity

    function addTreeRoot(bytes32 newRoot) external {
        treeRoots.push(newRoot);
        rootTimestamps[newRoot] = block.timestamp;
    }
    
    function verifyInAnyTree(
        bytes32[] calldata proof,
        bytes32 leaf
    ) external view returns (bool) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < treeRoots.length; i++) {
            if (MerkleProof.verify(proof, treeRoots[i], leaf)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
