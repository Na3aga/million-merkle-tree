## 🚀 Hybrid Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Tiered Update System
```solidity
contract TieredMerkleManager {
    IncrementalMerkleTreePush public liveTree;    // Real-time
    bytes32[] public batchRoots;                  // Batch updates
    
    function verifyInAnyTree(bytes32[] calldata proof, bytes32 leaf) 
        external view returns (bool) {
        // Check live tree first, then batch roots
    }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Cost-Optimized Batching
- Accumulate pending leaves for cost optimization
